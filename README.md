Gameplay:

Objective: Reveal all non-mine cells without hitting a mine.
Board: A grid of clickable cells, some hiding mines.
Controls:
Difficulty Dropdown: Choose Beginner, Intermediate, or Expert.
New Game Button: Start a new board with the selected difficulty.
Back to Home: Return to the landing page.


Interactions:
Left-Click: Reveal a cell. If it‚Äôs a mine, you lose; if safe, it shows a number (adjacent mines) or expands (if no adjacent mines).
Right-Click: Place/remove a flag (üö©) on a suspected mine to prevent clicking it.
First Click: Always safe, ensuring a playable start.


Status Messages:
‚ÄúGame Over! You hit a mine!‚Äù when you lose, showing all mines (üí£).
‚ÄúCongratulations! You won!‚Äù when you reveal all safe cells.




Tips:

Use numbers to deduce mine locations (e.g., a ‚Äú2‚Äù with two unrevealed neighbors means both are mines).
Flag cells you‚Äôre sure contain mines.
Start with Beginner to learn, then try Expert for a challenge!
